# Aloalo Island

![[Aloalo_Island1-1.jpg]]

>In a seldom-traveled corner of the south sea isles lies Aloalo, an island filled with lush vegetation and teeming with vibrant wildlife. Yet the survival of this paradise hinges on a delicate natural balance which has only grown more precarious since the island's stewards departed a century ago. Answering the plea of a messenger most peculiar, you must join Matsya on a journey to restore order to Aloalo, and in the process uncover secrets long forgotten

# Conservation Records

Each conservation record is gained by completing one of the twelve endings.
These are split by three paths that you must choose at the start.

## Left Path
### Record 1: A Not-quite Deserted Island

- When prompted by Matsya about fishing (he’ll have an exclamation point above his head), tell him: ==“We should press on.”==
- Ignore **Zeal-blind Zozone**, letting his HP deplete. He’ll call you a bastard and run off when his health bar empties.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 2: The First Settlers of Aloalo Island

- When prompted by Matsya about fishing (he’ll have an exclamation point above his head), tell him: ==“We should press on.”==
- Help **Zeal-blind Zozone**.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 3: God of Heaven and Sea

- When prompted by Mastya about fishing (he’ll have an exclamation point above his head), tell him: ==“Fish to your heart’s content.”==
- Interact with the ==patch of sand== on the right and give the bait to Matsya.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 4: A Noxious Gift

- When prompted by Mastya about fishing (he’ll have an exclamation point above his head), tell him: ==“Fish to your heart’s content.”==
- Interact with the ==mound of rocks== on the left and give the bait to Matsya.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

## Middle Path
### Record 5: The Roots of Arcanima

- After the midboss, kill the **crawlers** and **treant** in any order as long as they’re ==not standing on the sigil on the floor.==
- Kill the next sets of monsters normally and proceed to the boss.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 6: Under the Boughts of the Great Tree

- After the midboss, kill the **crawlers** and **treant** in any order as long as they’re ==not standing on the sigil on the floor.==
- On the next set of monsters, ==run through the red flower bushes== and follow the path to scare off the **armadillo-like rodents**.
- On the next set of monsters (again), do the same thing as above — ==run through the red flowers== to find the **armadillo-like rodents** and scare them off.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 7: A Dear Friend

- After the midboss, pull the **crawlers** and **treant** to be ==on top of the sigil== on the floor. While staying on the sigil, ==kill the **treant** first, and then kill the **crawlers**.==
- Head up the new path and kill the set of monsters.
- On the next and final set of monsters, fight the monsters, but ==do not hit== J**olly-tailed J’jhimei**.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 8: Fish for the Mind

- After the midboss, pull the **crawlers** and **treant** to be ==on top of the sigil== on the floor. While staying on the sigil, ==kill the **treant** first, and then kill the **crawlers**.==
- Head up the new path and kill the set of monsters.
- On the next and final set of monsters, ==attack== **Jolly-tailed J’jhimei**.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

## Right Path

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 10: The Remnants of Faith

- When you approach **Statice the pixie**, select: ==“I’m not interested in your ‘secrets.”==
- When prompted again, select: ==“I don’t know if I can...”==
- When prompted for the third time, select: ==“You just have a...wicked air about you.”==
- ==Don’t interact== with any of the **treasures** you see after taking the new path.
- ==Pull the lever== to take the path down.

───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────

### Record 11: A Lalafell or fish?

- When you approach **Statice the pixie**, select: ==“I’m not interested in your ‘secrets.”==

- ==Do not pull the lever== in the room with the statues.
- In the statue room, ==complete the rituals== for each statue.
- **Continue the steps bellow after the rituals.**
