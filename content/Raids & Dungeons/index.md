title: Raids & Dungeons

This section in our discord contains information related to instanced content like raids and dungeons.

For the most part it will be dungeons or long form content, as things like savage raids are better suited for video guides rather than walls of text.

>Content here will not go deep into story, however, instanced content has always been intertwined with the MSQ in some aspects, so there might be important characters from the MSQ or story related content that will be part of the information here.
