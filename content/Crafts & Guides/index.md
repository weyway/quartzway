title: Crafts & Guides
---
This section in our discord contains information related to crafting and well as guides for events or non-instanced content.

In here, you will probably not find information about crafting as that is too ephemeral to be worth the trouble or has already been extensively done by dedicated websites.

However, recurring events and relic weapons, will probably end up here.

>[!warning] Friendly warning!
>This type of information is openly visible within the FC's discord and is not hidden behind any spoiler tags since it's mostly aimed at past/ongoing events accessible to everyone OR general quest chain directions. 
>Still, if you don't want to get ahead of yourself spoiler wise, there might be NPC names or locations that will be shared in these.
>Relic guides will always be tagged with the expansion they belong to to help you avoid them if you so wish. ðŸ˜Š
