# Relic - Anima Weapons (HW)

![[Anima_Weapons_banner.png]]
# Lore

>A young researcher hailing from the Near East has come to Eorzea in search of aid. His field of study? Anima, an essence he considers to be a reflection of the soul. Through a chance encounter with the master craftsman Gerolt, he and the legendary blacksmith have joined forces to create a weapon the likes of which the realm has never seen.
>
>- Patch 3.1 Official Site

>Though it is only a matter of time before the anima fully develops, Ardashir believes he can hasten the process. To that end, he voyages to Idyllshire in search of an acquaintance, one Ulan. A fellow researcher and enthusiast of all creatures arcane, she has devoted her life to their study and methods by which they can be enhanced. Could her work be the key to unlocking the anima's potential?
>
>- Patch 3.3 Official Site

>After many tests and trials, the anima would appear to be at the pinnacle of perfection. To that end, Ardashir is making preparations to return to the Near East that he might present his findings. Gerolt, on the other hand, believes there is yet work to be done. Could our resident drunkard and realm-renown blacksmith hold the key to the anima's advancement?
>
>- Patch 3.4 Official Site

>As repair work on the Allagan droid progresses, it becomes clear that it won't be long until the anima weapon is fortified at last. Just what form will the anima take once all is said and done? Well, that's the million-gil question.

>- Patch 3.5 Official Site

# Prerequisites

As usual, there's a good website to help track where you stand on each of the steps of this relic grind: https://ffxivrelictracker.com/

- The level needed to complete this chain is **level 60** (obvious Wey is obvious).
- Completion of the Main Scenario Quest [Heavensward](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Heavensward_(Quest) "Heavensward (Quest)")

This relic will require a lot (like really a looot!) of **Allagan Tomestone of Poetics** as well as some **Grand Company Seals**

It's also heavily recommended to have at least **Second Lieutenant** rank on your **Grand Company** of choice to purchase some of the materials required (they can be obtained in the marketboard as well!)

# Initial Preparations

While this relic  has much less steps than the ARR one, the costs are condensed, as such, these quests will take well over 8000 **Allagan Tomestone of Poetics** to complete, it's recommended that you avoid the 2000 cap on tomestones by spending on whatever materials you can buy along the way.

The tables below will highlight some of the items that can be purchased and stocked up in preparation for the steps that will come.

Some items will not be available to buy until you reach the step and unlock them.
Note that I might've missed something here, but this should at least give you a head start.

>[!info] Info
>Some materials can be obtained via other means than what the tables specify, I've just organised them by tokens as that will cost less **Gil** in the long run.
>If you want to see other options of obtaining each, click on the material names.

# Quests
## 1 - Animated Weapons
![[An_Unexpected_Proposal.png]]

To start this relic, you will first need to complete a *one time only* quest: [An Unexpected Proposal](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/An_Unexpected_Proposal "An Unexpected Proposal")
This quest can be found in **Idyllshire** by speaking with [**Rowena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Rowena)*.

The quest will then send you to **Azys Lla** to speak with [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations) for the next quest.

After you reach **Azys Lla**, you will get access to the repeatable quest [Soul without Life](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Soul_without_Life "Soul without Life")which can be done every time you want to start a new relic (if doing multiple of them).

This quest requires that you obtain an [==**Astral Nodule**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Astral_Nodule "Astral Nodule") and an [==**Umbral Nodule**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Umbral_Nodule "Umbral Nodule") from [Syndony](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Syndony) which can be found in [Mor Dhona](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Mor_Dhona "Mor Dhona").

>[!tip] Tip!
>**Syndony** can be found on Mor Dhona on the balcony outside of the House of Splendors.
>![[Pasted image 20240531013036.png]]

This quest is unique in that it offers two options to obtain these items.

### The normal (and longer) option

Farm **FATEs** in each of the Heavensward zones to obtain crystals.
Only one crystal per zone is needed and it shouldn't be as bad as [[Relic - Zodiac Weapons (ARR)#3 - Atma|Atma]] from [[Relic - Zodiac Weapons (ARR)]].

See below where to go for each one.

|                                                  | Crystal                                                                                                                       | Zone                                                                                                                          |

### The faster alternative

If you still have your **[[Relic - Zodiac Weapons (ARR)#8 - Zeta|Zeta Weapon]]** you may turn this in instead to receive the two items required right away.

>[!Warning] This will cause you to lose the selected weapon you turn-in!
>If you don't care about keeping the original weapon and just want the glamour, you can always purchase a **Replica** from [Drake](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Drake_(NPC)) at any point after completing the relics.

## 2 - Awoken Weapons

For this step, we're back on the dungeon grind!

>[!check] Time to equip your newly found weapon from the previous quest ;D

This step starts by talking with [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations) who will give you the quest [Toughening Up](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Toughening_Up "Toughening Up") that will send you to complete **10 dungeons**.

These dungeons can be completed unsynced by using the **Unrestricted Party** option so this will be really quick!

### Dungeons

Easy ♥

## 3 - Anima Weapons

From here on out the big tomestonecalipse starts and you will have a much better time if you bought some of the materials before-hand.

Once again, [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations) will give you the next quest in the series.
This one is [Coming into Its Own](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Coming_into_Its_Own "Coming into Its Own")

To complete this quest, you will have to turn-in four items that need to be traded for using the materials below, these are: **==Enchanted Rubber==**, ==**Fast-drying Carboncoat**==, ==**Divine Water**==, and ==**Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst**==.

If you opt for buying the token items using **Allagan Tomestones of Poetics** be ready to be spend 6.000 total tomes getting all the required items.

### What will you need here

After you have all the needed items, turn them in to [**Cristiana**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Cristiana) in **Mor Dhona** to receive your upgraded weapon!

## 4 - Hyperconductive Anima Weapons
![[Finding_Your_Voice.png]]

Another currency dump quest.
This time it's 1750 tomestones. Gah!

This step will start with quest [Finding Your Voice](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Finding_Your_Voice "Finding Your Voice") given by [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations) on **Azyz Lla** and you will have to turn in **5** [**==Aether Oil==**](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Aether_Oil "Aether Oil").

You can find the **==Aether Oil==** at [**Hismena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Hismena) as referred earlier on this guide.

>[!info] Info
>This quest will grant access to the **Restoration Node** which also gives you access to purchasing all the replicas of the Anima Weapons!

---
## 5 - Reconditioned Anima Weapons
![[A_Dream_Fulfilled.png]]

This step is a bit more complex.
On this step you will add stat points to the **Hyperconductive Anima Weapon**.
It requires a total of **240 points** added by spending **==Treated Crystal Sand==** which can be obtained by combining **==Crystal Sand==** and **==Umbrite==**.

The quest to start this step is called [A Dream Fulfilled](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/A_Dream_Fulfilled) and starts, as usual, on **Azys Lla** given by [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations).
This will take you to [**Ulan**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ulan) in **Idyllshire** who will ask you to collect the items above.

For the [**==Umbrite==**](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Umbrite "Umbrite") you can go back to [**Hismena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Hismena) to purchase it for **75 tomestones** each.

>[!tip] Umbrite tips
>As this step depends heavily on RNG, the recommended quantity to get is between 50-60 **==Umbrite==** (you may get 50 and then add as needed).
>After 120 points, there's a chance to gain bonus points when converting the **==Treated Crystal Sand==**, helping with reducing the spending.

To obtain the [**==Crystal Sand==**](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Crystal_Sand "Crystal Sand") however, you will have to trade with [**Ulan**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ulan) for certain items.
Each trade grands 2 **==Crystal Sand==**.
While the list of items you can trade is extensive, most of them are horrible trades and some  of the items are no longer available at this point.

### Recommended trades

- 5x [Blue Crafters' Scrip Token](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Blue_Crafters%27_Scrip_Token "Blue Crafters' Scrip Token") - Costs 25 [White Crafters' Scrip](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/White_Crafters%27_Scrip "White Crafters' Scrip") (125 Total)
- 5x [Blue Gatherers' Scrip Token](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Blue_Gatherers%27_Scrip_Token "Blue Gatherers' Scrip Token") - Costs 25 [White Gatherers' Scrip](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/White_Gatherers%27_Scrip "White Gatherers' Scrip") (125 Total)
- 5x [Superior Enchanted Ink](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Superior_Enchanted_Ink "Superior Enchanted Ink") and [Thavnairian Mist](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Thavnairian_Mist "Thavnairian Mist") - Costs 25 and 20 [Allagan Tomestones of Poetics](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Allagan_Tomestones_of_Poetics "Allagan Tomestones of Poetics") respectively (125 and 100 total)

Another option that might be viable is buying primal parts, check the market board for prices.
Make sure you're pricing them together as you need 3 non-interchangeable items for a trade-in. Don't buy 2 of them for cheap only to find out that the third item is prohibitively expensive.

Below is the full list of all possible trades:

## 6 - Sharpened Anima Weapons
![[Future_Proof.png]]

For this step, it's... More Tomestones! Okay, not quite, you will also have supporting quests~~

Accept the quest [Future Proof](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Future_Proof "Future Proof") given by [**Ardashir**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ardashir#Locations).

The goal of this quest is to collect and turn in 50 [==**Singing Clusters**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Singing_Cluster "Singing Cluster").
How do you go about doing that then?
Well, these are the options to obtain the clusters:

### Always available source
Purchase the [==**Singing Clusters**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Singing_Cluster "Singing Cluster") from [**Hismena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Hismena) for 40 **Allagan Tomestones of Poetics**
### Limited availability sources
#### Daily
Repeatable quest [Cut from a Different Cloth](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Cut_from_a_Different_Cloth "Cut from a Different Cloth") will have you run **Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70/80** and will give you 1x [==**Singing Clusters**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Singing_Cluster "Singing Cluster").
#### Weekly
Repeatable weekly quest [Seeking Inspiration](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Seeking_Inspiration "Seeking Inspiration") will send you to **Duty Roulette: Leveling** for three runs, after which it will reward you with 18x [==**Singing Clusters**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Singing_Cluster "Singing Cluster").

## 7 - Complete Anima Weapons
![[Born_Again_Anima.png]]

For this step, we're back on the dungeon grind.
This step will open up two repeatable quests [Born Again Anima](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Born_Again_Anima "Born Again Anima") and [Some Assembly Required](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Some_Assembly_Required "Some Assembly Required").

### Born Again Anima
For the quest [Born Again Anima](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Born_Again_Anima "Born Again Anima") you have to complete three specific dungeons:
- [Sohm Al (Hard)](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Sohm_Al_(Hard) "Sohm Al (Hard)")
- [The Great Gubal Library (Hard)](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Great_Gubal_Library_(Hard) "The Great Gubal Library (Hard)")
- [The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Lost_City_of_Amdapor_(Hard) "The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)")

Deliver the quest rewards to [Gerolt](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Gerolt).

### Some Assembly Required
Accept the quest [Some Assembly Required](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Some_Assembly_Required "Some Assembly Required").

You will need to collect 15 [==**Pneumite**==](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Pneumite "Pneumite") to turn in for a [**==Newborn Soulstone==**](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Newborn_Soulstone "Newborn Soulstone").
This can be obtained by purchasing it with **100 Tomestones of Poetics** at [**Hismena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Hismena) or at your **Grand Company Quartermaster** for **4.000 Company Seals** each (60.000 total).

Afterwards, you'll have to grind **Aetheric Density**.
You can earn this via many options based on Heavensward content, including **FATEs, dungeons, trials and raids**.

>[!tip] Recommended!
>Farming **Alexander Savage Raids** unsynced is usually the fastest way to complete the Aetheric grind.
>A9S is a good option, but any of them from 9 to 12 will work.
>These will give you **96 Aetheric Density** for each clear which means you will only have to do them around 20 times to max out your relic.

After the trials are all complete, all that's missing is purchasing **1 ==Archaic Enchanted Ink==** from [**Hismena**](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Hismena) for **500 Tomestones**!

After you turn this in, it's done!

Congratulations!
