title: Summary Live Letters
---
As live letters are usually very image heavy, posting these on discord even using threads is very annoying.
Since I gather the information in bulk before I organise it and split it into pieces for discord, this format will align better with my own crazy ways as I won't have to split anything in discord posts.

`Retention`
In order to avoid this page becoming massive, I will only include the current expansion's Live Letters.
If there's relevant content in it, the previous Live Letter before an expansion is released will also be retained.
Anything outside of the above, will be eventually removed at the launch of a new expansion patch cycle (as my time allows). ðŸ˜Š


>[!warning] Friendly warning!
>This is public information and is live-streamed by the developers, however, the nature of these will always go into future content scheduled to release.
>While the devs take care to avoid spoiling anything, if you like to jump in completely blind into new patches, you can avoid checking these.
