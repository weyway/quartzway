## Frontline: The Borderlands Ruins (Secure)
### Basic rules
- Up to 72 players, divided into three teams of 24 (standard frontline stuff)
- Objective: Increase the tactical rating and be the first team to the designated score
- Tactical rating can be achieved by:
	- Occupying any of the 9 key locations on the map
	- Battling against Allagan weaponry
	- Defeating other players
- The Key Locations
	- A team can occupy a key location when they are the only team in the vicinity for a short period
	- Holding more locations will increase how fast you get tactical rating score
	- Enemy teams' locations (presumably the ones closer to enemy spawns) can also be claimed
	- Sheer Will Buff: Standing inside the area of the key location (looks like a ring around it) will grant a massive damage buff to ALL players, regardless of what team is occupying the location
- Allagan Weaponry
	- After a certain amount of time, Allagan weaponry will appear at the centre of the map
- Teleporters
	- After some time, three teleporters will appear on the outskirts to immediately transport players to the centre of the map

- A balanced party will be automatically formed if all members are within 3 levels of each other
- If a member is 4 levels or more apart, you can manually activate the sync to become a balanced party (e.g. If a level 4 groups with a level 6, they will have to trigger the sync to become a balanced party)

### Critical Encounters
- These are large-scale battles against bosses

- If more than 48 players stand upon the aetherial node, players will be randomly selected for entry. Those who have used the ciphers to activate the node will have a higher chance of being selected.
### Treasure in the Wild
